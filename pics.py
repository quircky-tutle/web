             It all started in room 201 in the statistics class, the first time I saw you.
             I remember seeing you entering the room and you just left me lost in my own thought
             I was like "ouuuffff, who is this", that was the moment you caught my attention,
             and you have never left ever since.
             Fast forward a bit, I will never forget our talks in the mornings at the IT square, we fought, laughed,
             and most importantly I got to know you more.
             Look how far we've come !!!
