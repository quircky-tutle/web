This journey has been rough i'm not gonna lie, we had our fair share of good days and the bad as well. But one 
thing i'm sure about is that i'm gonna stick with you no matter what happens, thick or thin, good or bad,
عالحلوة و المرة, you are my favorite person and you always and forever will be. Fun fact, As I am writing this, you are on the verge of blocking me, 
but here some flowers to compensate for what I did 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹. Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that I love you 
when you are angry, sad, cheerful, happy and even when you feel that you do not love me. Lastly, I promise
to take care of you till the last day of my life, and I promise you that I will always be the one who loves you no matter what.
And I promise that we will get married eshallah soon. I LOVE YOU SEMSEM ❤️❤️. Here is the most recent picture of us on my phone.
